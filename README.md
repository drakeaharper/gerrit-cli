## Installation

### From Source

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Go 1.21 or later
   - Git
   - SSH access to your Gerrit server
   - Gerrit HTTP password (found in Gerrit Settings â†’ HTTP Password)

2. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/drakeaharper/gerrit-cli.git
   cd gerrit-cli
   ```

3. **Build and install**

   ```

4. **Initialize configuration**

   ```

### Using Go Install

```bash
go install github.com/drakeaharper/gerrit-cli/cmd/gerry@latest
gerry init
```

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize gerry** (first time only)
   ```bash
   gerry init
   ```
   This will walk you through setting up your Gerrit server connection.

2. **List your open changes**
   ```bash
   gerry list
   ```

3. **View comments on a change**
   ```bash
   gerry comments 384465
   ```

4. **Fetch a change locally**
   ```bash
   gerry fetch 384465
   ```

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in `~/.gerry/config.json`. You can also use environment variables:

- `GERRIT_SERVER`: Gerrit server hostname
- `GERRIT_PORT`: SSH port (default: 29418)
- `GERRIT_USER`: Your Gerrit username
- `GERRIT_HTTP_PASSWORD`: Your HTTP password
- `GERRIT_PROJECT`: Default project

### Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "server": "gerrit.example.com",
  "port": 29418,
  "http_port": 8080,
  "user": "your-username",
  "http_password": "your-http-password",
  "ssh_key": "/path/to/ssh/key",
  "project": "default-project"
}
```

**Note about ports:**
- `port`: SSH port (usually 29418)
- `http_port`: HTTP/HTTPS port for REST API (common values: 443, 8080, 8443)
  - If not specified, auto-detection will try to determine the correct port
  - For SSH port 29418, it defaults to HTTPS on port 443

Environment variables take precedence over configuration file values.
